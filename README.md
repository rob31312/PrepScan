# PrepScan
PrepScan is an app that inventories emergency supplies in containers by scanning containers and items.

The project idea wiki describes the initial concept with some AI generated art for the first wire frame and a wireframe in FIGMA https://github.com/rob31312/PrepScan/wiki/First-draft-of-Project-Idea

The latest updates include a final wire frame built in Android Studio and demonstrates all screens and navigation https://github.com/rob31312/PrepScan/wiki/Final-version-of-Wire-Frame
